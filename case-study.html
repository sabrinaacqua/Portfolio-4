    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>I worked on a group project to redesign a non-profit 
        organization's website with the aim of improving its usability. 
        As part of this project, we were responsible for creating a 
        simple, interactive website prototype, as well as a 
        corresponding mobile prototype.</p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>We redesigned the Sea Blue Canada website to 
        make it more visually appealing and easy to use. We want to 
        make interactions easier for existing users and find ways to 
        attract more users as well.</p>

    <h3>Role & Responsibility</h3>
    <p>Group consisting of four people, one of them being me. We all 
        collaborated together for 95% of the project. The last 5% was 
        towards the end of the project, half of the group iterated the 
        prototypes and the other half worked on the presentation.</p>
    
    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <p>Figma, FigJam, Trello, Paper & Pen, Google Drive, Canva</p>

    <h3>Timeline & Scope</h3>
    <p>3-week period to complete project</p>

    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>In the first phase of our project, we started off by creating a 
        proto-persona, to get the idea of who our user might be. Once 
        completing this, we drafted an interview plan. 
        
        Surveys and user interviews, 18-40 year olds intrested in ocean 
        conservation, were conducted to evaluate the usabiltiy of the 
        current site and to identify SeaBlue's target audience, so we could 
        understand the demographic and possible motivations. We found 
        that users expperienced couldn't understand what SeaBlue was 
        and had issues navigating the platform. 
        
        We then we used the data from our affinity diagram to contruct 
        a user persona and empathy map. We found it resembled our 
        proto-persona but helped us more clearly understand our user.</p>

        <h3>Definiton & Synthesis</h3>
        <p>When it came to the definition phase, we finalized our user insight
            statement as well as our hypothesis and problem. 
           
           User Insight: Environmentally conscious young adults like Emilia
           are deeply concerned about the state of the oceans, but feel 
           helpless to take on the governments and massive industries in 
           control of oceans resources. 
           
           Hypothesis: We suspect users visiting the SeaBlue website might 
           leave feeling unclear on who SeaBlue is and what they do. Users 
           may care deeply about the cause but struggle to navigate the site 
           and learn how they can take action or become involved.
           
           Problem: Environmentally conscious individuals who care about 
           ocean preservation are doing their best to minimize their carbon 
           footprint; but when exploring the SeaBlue Canada website they 
           feel overwhelmed with information and confused with information 
           and confused how to take action.</p>
